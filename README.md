# Arch-setup

A single file and fully customizable installer script for archlinux.

## Purpose

Archlinux is a distro that it gives full control to anyone who wants to install this distro. With their comprehensive [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), one can find satisfying answers to his/her questions and can follow various guides to achieve his/her customized installation. By writing this script, I wanted to retain this customizability while on the other hand automating my installation proccess.

## Goals

- Being fully transparent

- Ease of customization

- Explanation of each sections (of the code)

## Pros

- Exactly follows the [archlinux installation guide]([Installation guide - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)).

- Automatically installs a Desktop Environment

- Automatically installs an Aur helper (which is yay)

- Automatically installs a set of packages (both aur and official)

- And most importantly, you have the opportunity to browse and edit the code directly. With this way, you can tailor it the way you want.
